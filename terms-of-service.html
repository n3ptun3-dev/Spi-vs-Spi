            <p>
                These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Spi vs Spi game (the "Game"), developed by n3ptun3 ("we," "us," or "our"). By playing the Game, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don't dig these Terms, then don't play the Game. Simple as that.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-emerald-400 mb-4">1. Your Account</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
                <li>You must be at least 18 years old to play the Game.</li>
                <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any game account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.</li>
                <li>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms or if we believe your actions are harmful to the Game or other players.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-emerald-400 mb-4">2. License to Play</h2>
            <p>
                We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Game for your personal, non-commercial entertainment. This means you can play it, but you can't sell it or mess with its code.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-emerald-400 mb-4">3. Prohibited Conduct</h2>

            <p>
                If the Game allows you to create or submit content (e.g., in-game chat, custom designs), you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content in connection with the Game. Basically, if you make it in our game, we can use it to make the game cooler.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-emerald-400 mb-4">5. Virtual Items and Currency (if applicable)</h2>
