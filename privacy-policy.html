            <p>
                We won't sell your personal information to third parties, because that's just shifty. We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">

            <p>
                We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is ever completely secure, so we can't guarantee absolute security. But we'll do our best to keep your data safe, just like you protect your sandcastles from the tide!
